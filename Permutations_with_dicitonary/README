#In this project we are given a dictionary of words.
#The end user is prompted to input a sequence of letters.
#All permutations of the letters are generated to find the mathcing words in the dictonary.
#Via backtracking we make sure that only appropriate permutatins(ie those that can potnetially mathc words) are generated and saved.
